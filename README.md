# Cake Randomizer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xamebax/cake-randomizer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xamebax/cake-randomizer)

I am here to take your baking to the next level.

Lives under https://cake-randomizer.herokuapp.com.

## Usage

<!-- TODO: Fill me out. -->

## Run

This is a Rust webapp. It uses Rocket (and thus requires a nightly Rust release).

To launch it locally, run:

```bash
$ cargo build
$ cargo run
```

## Contributing

Hey, you think something's missing? I'd love a PR! An issue will also do. Bear in mind that Cake Randomizer is only compatible with vegan ingredients.
